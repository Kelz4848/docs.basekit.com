# Menu

Version: >= 7.32. Add an Menu List to the Page (i.e. Restaurant menu)

## Overview

**IMPORTANT: This widget will only work as expected when the menu plugin is activated on the user's account.** This widget is used to display a list of items, dishes, services with a price as per our menu functionality. Lots of HTML generated here based on the complexity of the menu.

{% highlight ruby %}
{% raw %}

	{{widget('menu', 'thisunqiuewidgetname', {})|raw}}

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
