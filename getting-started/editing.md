# Editing & Uploading a Template

This document will explain how to use our TDK and how to upload that final template. If you haven’t downloaded your template for editing yet please check out the [How to download a template](/getting-started/downloading/) documentation.

Welcome to the Template Viewer/TDK where you can view your template on your local machine.

Use your [code editor](/getting-started/#a-code-editor) of choice to open your chosen template. In our example below we are using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) editor:

You will see your folder options - Feel free to rename these or take a look inside.

Once you have made your code changes you might want to 'update' with the Template Viewer to view those changes and make sure everything works. You can do this as you go along if preferred. You can do this by clicking the update button at the top right hand corner of the Template Viewer. This will then pull your masterpiece of code from your chosen code editor into the Template Viewer.

If you are happy with your changes you can then save the file to upload to BaseKit and back to the editor. Zip the file back up with your changes click on the 'Save as Zip' button. You will then need to find your zip file on your computer - This would normally be where your downloaded items end up. 

Open up the BaseKit Editor and click on the template panel on the left hand side.

You’ll automatically be directed to a page where you will need to choose your template zip file:

Once you have selected your file click on the **Upload** button.

Your template and any changes made will have uploaded to the Editor for you to make further content changes if needed.
