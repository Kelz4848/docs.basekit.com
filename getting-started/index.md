# Getting Started

You'll need the following before you start working on a template:

1. ## Access to the Editor
  * If you have come to us through the editor, you will already be signed up and logged in via your hosting/telecoms package. [Head straight to Step 2](#a-code-editor).
  * If you already have an account but are not logged in, do so now.
  * Don't have an account? Head to our [developer partner page](http://www.basekit.com/developers) to find a partner to sign up with.

2. ## Enable Developer Mode 
   To do this, simply click the `Developer` tab in the Editor. 
   By accepting the terms and conditions you understand you need a good knowledge of HTML and CSS to be able to use this feature.

3. ## Start coding!
   The code editor will appear. You can start editing your template's files via this editor. Once you have completed the changes to the file, click Save. 

4. ## Want to use your own editor?
   No problem! BaseKit has built an offline Template Viewer that you can run on your local machine. Simply follow the instructions on this page: [Build templates on your local machine](http://docs.basekit.com/getting-started/local-development/).
