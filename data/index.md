# Data

Feeding data into a template is easy with BaseKit Development tools. Using Twig tags you can render this data straight into HTML!

There are many data sources exposed to a template that can be used to populate a template. Data relating to the site, page, user and plugins. A list of data objects are listed below, each with its own documentation explaining what the value relates to and how a user updates it.

* [Site](/data/site/)
* [Page](/data/page/)
* [Profile](/data/profile/)
* [Plugin](/data/plugin/) (includes asset, blog, ecommerce and menu data)
